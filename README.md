🌾 Crop Disease Detection & Yield Prediction
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to detect plant leaf diseases across multiple crop types and predict the quantitative yield loss, fulfilling the advanced requirements for the Longathon AI/ML project.

Project Goal
The primary goal is to provide an end-to-end system that performs:

Multi-Class Classification: Identifying one of 22 disease/healthy classes using transfer learning models (DenseNet-121).

Regression Analysis: Estimating potential yield loss percentage using a Random Forest Regressor.

🛠️ Setup and Installation
A. Environment Setup (Critical)
This project requires a specific Python environment because modern Streamlit and older TensorFlow versions conflict. We use a Conda environment to guarantee compatibility.

Install Conda: Download and install Miniconda.

Create Environment: Open your Anaconda Prompt and execute the following command to create a stable environment with Python 3.10:

Bash

conda create -n tf_crop_env python=3.10
Activate Environment:

Bash

conda activate tf_crop_env
Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries inside the new environment. (This uses specific versions known to work together).

Bash

pip install tensorflow==2.10.0 numpy==1.23.5 pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib streamlit==1.25.0 pillow
B. Project Structure
Your project requires the following folders in the root directory:

re-ai/
├── data/           # Contains datasets (train/test folders)
├── models/         # Stores trained models (.h5, .joblib)
├── src/            # Contains all executable Python scripts
├── figures/        # Stores result images (Confusion Matrix)
├── app.py          # The main Streamlit web application
└── README.md
🏃 Running the Project (For Evaluation)
The models have been trained on a large, combined dataset (PlantVillage + Apple + Coffee), and the weights are stored locally.

1. Verification of Trained Models
The following files must be present in the /models directory for the system to run:

DenseNet121_best.h5

rf_regressor.joblib (Random Forest model)

2. Launching the Web Application (Demonstration)
To run the final, interactive demonstration required for evaluation, execute the Streamlit app from the project root:

Activate Environment: conda activate tf_crop_env

Navigate to Root: cd path/to/your/re-ai

Run Application:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
The application will open in your browser (http://localhost:8501).

How the Prediction Works:
The app.py script performs a two-stage process:

Diagnosis: The uploaded leaf image is passed to the DenseNet-121 model to determine the Predicted Class (e.g., Tomato Bacterial Spot) and Confidence.

Regression: The output (Confidence and Predicted Crop Type) is fed into the Random Forest Regressor to predict the final Potential Yield Loss (%).

📊 Evaluation and Metrics (For Grading)
All final performance metrics and plots are generated by running the scripts located in the /src directory.

Final Classification Metrics
To verify the classification results used in Section 6.1 of the report:

Navigate: cd src

Run Evaluation: (Enter DenseNet121 when prompted)

Bash

python evaluate_clf.py
(This generates the Confusion Matrix image: figures/cm_DenseNet121.png)

Final Regression Metrics
To verify the yield prediction results used in Section 6.2 of the report:

Navigate: cd src

Run Regressor:

Bash

python train_regressor.py
(This prints MSE, RMSE, R², and MAE to the console)
